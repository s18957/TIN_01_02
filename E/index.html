    <h1> Avril Lavigne </h1>
      <p> Canadian singer Avril Lavigne burst onto the music scene in the early 2000s, 
        becoming a hit with her unique style which blended rock and punk. 
        She spent most of her childhood in Napanee, Ontario. 
        Lavigne began singing in church at a young age, and signed with Arista Records in 2000. 
        Two years later, she released her debut album, Let Go. 
        Thanks to hit singles "Complicated" and "Sk8er Boi", 
        the record sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. 
        Lavigne followed with the albums Under My Skin (2004), 
        The Best Damn Thing (2007), Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013).</p>

			<p> The way he tells it, Yungblud had no choice but to be a rock star. 
              In one of the first photos ever taken of him, a few hours after being born, 
              he’s outside the hospital holding a ukulele with a painted image of the Beatles 
              on the instrument’s face. Later, growing up in Doncaster, England — an industrial town 
              that he describes as “the Detroit of the U.K.” — he never quite fit in with his peers. 
              “I didn’t think I was going to be a lawyer,” he says matter-of-factly. 
              “Where I grew up, putting on make-up or wearing a skirt or even playing 
              rock music was not really seen as honest.”. </p>
